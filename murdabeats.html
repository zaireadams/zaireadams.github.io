<div class="h1"><h1>Murda Beatz, an ‘Alien’ in Rap, Can’t Stop Making Hits 
By Joe Coscarelli

	<div class="text"><p>LOS ANGELES — Shane Lindstrom, an easygoing 24-year-old from the undistinguished Canadian side of Niagara Falls, cuts a curious figure for a rap-world star.</p>
	<p>He has a young man’s beard, fuller off the edges of his face, and a feathered bowl of reddish-blond hair that often flops onto his designer sunglasses. His cluster of diamond chains includes one depicting an oversized chef emoji, complementing his iced-out, rose gold Audemars Piguet watch.

But it’s Lindstrom’s producer name that is maybe most jarring for an amiable dude from north of the border: Murda Beatz, or just Murda to everyone who knows him.

“People aren’t expecting me to look how I do,” he said recently. “But that’s one of the main reasons it works so well: the surprise factor.”</p>
<p>It first worked about five years ago when, after some long-shot social-media networking, a less flashy Murda showed up on Chicago’s South Side to collaborate with Chief Keef’s GBE crew. And it worked again soon after when Murda appeared on the Atlanta doorstep of a then-little-known trio calling itself Migos.

“They just really wanted to get me out there to make sure I was making my beats, because they were fire,” Murda recalled. “They didn’t believe that I was the kid making them.”

In the years since, Murda Beatz has moved steadily, alongside his old friends in Migos, through the mixtape circuit and onto the pop charts. As his instrumentals have evolved from faithful versions of the ominous, 808-heavy Atlanta trap sound perfected by Zaytoven and Lex Luger toward more melodic, sample-based and elaborate compositions, his clientele has also expanded.
</p> <p>Singles like 2 Chainz’s “It’s a Vibe” and Travis Scott’s “Butterfly Effect,” as well as a smattering of Drake album cuts and features, led to a sonic boom for Murda this year: “MotorSport” by Migos, featuring Cardi B and Nicki Minaj, was too big to fail, settling in the Top 10; Drake’s “Nice for What,” built around an undeniable Lauryn Hill sample, spent eight warm weeks at No. 1; and “Fefe,” which brought together Minaj and 6ix9ine, the rap villain of the moment, peaked at No. 3 on its way to nearly half a billion YouTube views.
</p>
<p>Now Murda is on the path to headline his own tracks à la Calvin Harris and DJ Khaled (“but bigger,” he said). The demand for his beats, along with his connections, has resulted in a deal with Interscope Records as both an artist in his own right and the head of a label imprint to foster talent.</p>
<p>But joining the rap establishment as an in-demand producer can also mean that you’ve been stamped with an expiration date. Artists and listeners are fickle, always searching for the next sound, and hip-hop is a veritable graveyard of producers who defined a moment only to wither.

“People get content — they buy their house, their cars, their grills, and they get comfortable,” Murda acknowledged. “But I’m not here to be hot for a year.”</p> <p>In an interview over a sushi dinner and, later, at a Koreatown driving range, a boyish Murda, who whacked golf balls with “Happy Gilmore”-esque abandon, said he was steeling himself for the future now that he’d made it to the top.

He was in the process of surrounding himself with a group of collaborative producers who would work to “keep recreating the sound of music,” he said. And he planned to move away from quantity, the prevailing ideology in modern rap, toward bespoke quality, building songs and whole projects in the same room with top-tier rappers. (Pop singers have also come calling.)</p><p>The five-times-platinum “Nice for What” was an inflection point. Rather than dropping off a premade digital beat pack, his biggest hit to date was made at Drake’s house, over a game of “NBA 2K18,” when the rapper ordered up a beat with a female vocal sample and Murda made it on the spot. (Drake located the song’s additional Big Freedia sample himself on YouTube, Murda said; the producer BlaqNmilD later added the New Orleans bounce section.)

The process was a throwback to Murda’s pre-fame days living in an Atlanta studio with Migos, creating five to 10 songs a day. But while Murda first made a name for himself on mixtapes like “No Label 2,” he existed on rap’s periphery until returning to Canada in 2014 and meeting Cory Litwin, a Toronto night life presence who became his manager.</p>
