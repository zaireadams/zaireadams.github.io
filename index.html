	<h1>The 5 most important developments in Hip-Hop production</h1>
	<body>
		<h2>1. New York block parties</h2>
		<p1>Documenting hip-hop history is tricky. Depending on who you talk to and what you read, the origins differ. But one thing is for sure: the block parties organized by DJ Kool Herc in The Bronx, New York City during the early 1970s were pivotal in hip-hop’s development as both a genre and culture.</p1><br>
<p2>Inspired by the dancehall environments and toasting witnessed in his hometown of Kingston, Jamaica, Kool Herc would extend the break section of a funk or soul song by switching back and forth between two copies of the same record, while engaging with dancers using the mic in a call-and-response routine.</p2>
<p3>The collaborative style of DJing developed Kool Herc and later perfected by DJ Grandmaster Flash and emcee Kurtis Blow, became the blueprint for hip-hop production. In 1979, a string of records considered hip-hop were released, bringing the sampled-based sound from New York’s African-American music community to record shops around the world.

<p4>Sugarhill Gang’s “Rapper’s Delight,” based on a sampled riff from Chic’s “Good Times” is the most notable release from this time. In addition to becoming one of the first successful hip-hop songs, charting in US, Canada, the UK, it also began the still topical debate on authorship and ownership in music. Chic would eventually sue Sugarhill Records for copyright infringement, and rapper Grandmaster Cas accused the group of stealing his lyrics</p4>
<p5>Although some 1970s hip-hop productions included backing musicians, the turntable was the main instrument. The creativity of hip-hop was in the process of recording and stitching together bits of existing sounds, just as much as any of the musical elements themselves.</p5>
<h2>2. Drum machines and MPCs</h2>
<p6>Introduced in 1980, Roland’s TR-808 quickly became the hip-hop drum machine. Instead of relying on breakbeats, producers could now write original drum patterns, speeding up the production process. The deep, 808 bass drum sound was also desired for its solid performance on club PA systems. Syncopated 808 drum beats paired with original and sampled synthesizer sequences formed the basis of electro and electro hip-hop hybrids, like Warp 9’s “Nunk.”

Hip-hop’s love affair with the 808 is as strong as ever today. Trap music, comfortably positioned at the top of streaming charts, makes heavy use of 808 kicks, snares, and hi-hats.

<p7>The Emu SP-1200, released in 1987 was one of the first commercially available and affordable digital samplers. Its low sampling rate of 26.04 Hz (!!) was influential in the development of the gritty New York hip-hop sound between 1985–1995.

One year later, the first Akai MPC model, the MPC60, came along. It became a hugely popular machine among hip-hop producers due to its long sample time (13 seconds compared to 2.5 seconds on the SP-1200), unique sonic character, and real-time programming capabilities. DJ Shadow’s use of the MPC60 to produce almost the entirely of his 1996 debut album Endtroducing… helped elevate sampling to art form status and spawn the instrumental hip-hop movement</p7> <p8>While sampling had been explored many years earlier by electroacoustic pioneers like Pierre Schaeffer and Karlheinz Stockhausen, and even the Beatles, but it had not been used to create entire songs aimed at mainstream audiences.</p8>
