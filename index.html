		<div class="text"><h2>New York block parties</h2>
		<p>Documenting hip-hop history is tricky. Depending on who you talk to and what you read, the origins differ. But one thing is for sure: the block parties organized by DJ Kool Herc in The Bronx, New York City during the early 1970s were pivotal in hip-hop’s development as both a genre and culture.</p><br>
<p>Inspired by the dancehall environments and toasting witnessed in his hometown of Kingston, Jamaica, Kool Herc would extend the break section of a funk or soul song by switching back and forth between two copies of the same record, while engaging with dancers using the mic in a call-and-response routine.</p>
<p>The collaborative style of DJing developed Kool Herc and later perfected by DJ Grandmaster Flash and emcee Kurtis Blow, became the blueprint for hip-hop production. In 1979, a string of records considered hip-hop were released, bringing the sampled-based sound from New York’s African-American music community to record shops around the world.
</p>
<p>Sugarhill Gang’s “Rapper’s Delight,” based on a sampled riff from Chic’s “Good Times” is the most notable release from this time. In addition to becoming one of the first successful hip-hop songs, charting in US, Canada, the UK, it also began the still topical debate on authorship and ownership in music. Chic would eventually sue Sugarhill Records for copyright infringement, and rapper Grandmaster Cas accused the group of stealing his lyrics</p>
<p>Although some 1970s hip-hop productions included backing musicians, the turntable was the main instrument. The creativity of hip-hop was in the process of recording and stitching together bits of existing sounds, just as much as any of the musical elements themselves.</p>
<h2> Drum machines and MPCs</h2>
<p>Introduced in 1980, Roland’s TR-808 quickly became the hip-hop drum machine. Instead of relying on breakbeats, producers could now write original drum patterns, speeding up the production process. The deep, 808 bass drum sound was also desired for its solid performance on club PA systems. Syncopated 808 drum beats paired with original and sampled synthesizer sequences formed the basis of electro and electro hip-hop hybrids, like Warp 9’s “Nunk.”

Hip-hop’s love affair with the 808 is as strong as ever today. Trap music, comfortably positioned at the top of streaming charts, makes heavy use of 808 kicks, snares, and hi-hats.

</p>
<p>The Emu SP-1200, released in 1987 was one of the first commercially available and affordable digital samplers. Its low sampling rate of 26.04 Hz (!!) was influential in the development of the gritty New York hip-hop sound between 1985–1995.

One year later, the first Akai MPC model, the MPC60, came along. It became a hugely popular machine among hip-hop producers due to its long sample time (13 seconds compared to 2.5 seconds on the SP-1200), unique sonic character, and real-time programming capabilities. DJ Shadow’s use of the MPC60 to produce almost the entirely of his 1996 debut album Endtroducing… helped elevate sampling to art form status and spawn the instrumental hip-hop movement</p> <p>While sampling had been explored many years earlier by electroacoustic pioneers like Pierre Schaeffer and Karlheinz Stockhausen, and even the Beatles, but it had not been used to create entire songs aimed at mainstream audiences.</p>
<h2> The rise of the gangster persona and sound</h2>
<p>By the mid-1980s, hip-hop had dropped its funk influences and turned toward rock for both style and samples. Punk guitarist-turned-Def Jam producer Rick Rubin drove this change. His sparse productions blending hard-hitting, guitars, and turntablism pushed artists like LL Cool J, and groups such as Beastie Boys, Run-D.M.C., and Public Enemy into mainstream success and diversified the hip-hop sound.

Sonics aside, the music made by Rubin during this time was intended for mainstream audiences. Unlike lengthy early hip-hop tracks intended for DJs, his productions were between three and four minutes so they could more easily gain airplay.  

The politically charged lyrics and aggressive sound design explored in the records above lay the the foundation for the gangsta rap sound, perhaps best summed up by Los-Angeles group N.W.A.’s debut album Straight Outta Compton, released in 1988.</p> <p>The album’s production, handled by N.W.A. member Dr. Dre, made use of mostly sampled breaks, 808s, horn stabs, and funk guitar samples recreated by musicians. While it’s considered groundbreaking mostly for its taboo and often violent lyrical material, the album is worth a re-listen just to hear Dr. Dre’s razor-sharp sample edits, wide panning, and balanced mix capable of handling up to six rappers’ distinct voices, with sometimes two or three raising hell at the same time.

Despite being refused radio airplay and receiving condemnation from government and religious organizations, “Straight Outta Compton” went triple platinum, and the gangster persona and related lyrics would became the driving force of hip-hop sales for years to come.</p>
<p>1990s hip-hop was dominated by the feud between the artists and fans of East Coast and West Coast music, record labels Death Row and Bad Boy, and rappers Tupac and Biggie. The stories that rappers could tell and the image they could portray remained limited until the early 2000s. The dependance on major record labels to achieve success and establish a fanbase meant that even the most financially successful rappers during this time, like Jay-Z, Snoop Dogg, and 50 Cent, had to maintain their gangster persona.

That being said, there was still truth in this subgenre of hip-hop. By openly discussing political, social, and racial issues rarely brought up in public forums, hip-hop artists forced listeners to think more critically.</p>
<h2> Daisy Age</h2>
<p>Daisy age, a catchall for chilled-out 1990s hip-hop that either criticized or ignored gangsta rap, was pioneered by New York-based groups like a Tribe Called Quest and De La Soul. Their music was characterized by eclectic sampling, experimental sound design, a wide range of new lyrical topics including spirituality, activism, and technology.

On ATCQ’s sophomore album Low End Theory, released in 1992, producer Q-Tip was praised for the high-quality production and use laid-back bebop samples. While this light-hearted, quirky style of hip-hop only remained popular for a few years, it would set the foundation for the transition from gangsta rap to the introspective, stylistically-broad music of Kanye West and his peers during the early and mid-2000s.</p> <p>The expanding tastes of music consumers due to Internet music sharing made it easier for hip-hop artists to find success exploring new directions and narratives outside of the traditional hardcare-gangster moulds. West’s winning of the 2007 album sales competition with 50 Cent is representative of this. Hip-hop came to accept influences as far-ranging as indie, gospel, electronic and classical, introducing new tempos and atmospheres to the genre.

Additionally, the popularity of Erykah Badu and Lauryn Hill’s smooth neo soul—a descendent of R&B with strong female presence—provided an alternative for male artists uninterested with the hedonism of hip-hop to explore more vulnerable themes like heartbreak.</p>
