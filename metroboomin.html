<div class="h1"><h1>The Boom Years</h1></div>
		<div class="text"><p>This story appears in Issue 16 of Highsnobiety Magazine. In just a few years, Leland Wayne – better known as Metro Boomin – has become hip-hop’s most in-demand producer, spawned several memes, and ushered in a new sound taking the music to a new level. Besides his innate talent, his work ethic is what got him there.

Metro Boomin is meticulous about everything – especially his ‘fits. Right now, it’s 2 o’clock on a Tuesday afternoon in a small loft in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. The sun peeks through the industrial windows during its limited time in the winter sky, albeit the weather is forgiving for an otherwise chilly February. It’s a balmy 55 degrees Fahrenheit outside, compared to New York’s usual 32°F and below. Speaking of shining, the ambient sun rays dance around one particular part of the room – the space where Metro is rummaging through an LV bag chock-full of jewelry.
</p>
<p>Born in St. Louis as Leland Tyler Wayne, the producer got his start in middle school. In seventh grade, he was already expressing his passion for music playing bass guitar in band class. That Christmas, his mom got him a laptop, on which he downloaded the rudimentary music production program FruityLoops after hearing about it from friends. He started messing around with it, aspiring to be a rapper, mostly because of Nelly’s Country Grammar.</p><p>“That was one of my first real CDs,” he admits. “It was my first explicit CD. Country Grammar came out, and it just made me want to rap. That simple.”

Metro wanted to rap, but knew he needed beats first. He wasn’t in a position to buy any, so he decided to make his own. As he dived deeper into production, he found out he liked it a lot more than rapping – and it was a less crowded market to compete in, with more aspiring rappers than aspiring producers. Soon, he threw himself fully into hip-hop production, establishing the monster work ethic he’s known for today. In high school, he was making about five beats a day.</p>
<p>“I really couldn’t buy any beats, so I just started trying to make my own,” he says. “I just figured so many people wanted to rap, so I had to choose some other shit.”

Of course, being a teenager telling your mom you want to pursue a career in rap is the kind of thing most parents would quickly dismiss as a pipe dream, but Metro was prepared. He had a green folder with information on all the artists he wanted to work with. He’d done his research online, printed out a document and presented it to his mom. She’s been his biggest supporter ever since.“I was always telling my aunties, my grandma, and everybody I want to be a producer. It just sounded better,” he says. “Sounded like it had more business. It just sounded better than being a rapper. Especially rap from back then I think is well… you know.”</p><p>What Metro means is that in the mid-2000s, hip-hop was still largely known for gangsta rap in the post-Biggie and Tupac era. The sound had evolved and the gang affiliations had tempered, but among the most prolific artists of the time were JAY-Z, 50 Cent, Dipset, and Eminem – all of whom, in many ways, still glorified the violence, rampant misogyny, and drug culture that kept hip-hop from being truly mainstream. It was on the precipice of a huge shift however, with a bubbling underground movement of “backpack rap” fueled by conscious lyricism, and a new crop of Southern rappers making music people could just party to. There was also an interest in Atlanta’s hip-hop scene, where seminal groups like OutKast were taking the culture forward by making music that bent and broke the preconceived rules of the genre.

That scene in particular struck a chord with a teenage Metro, and he used nascent social media platforms like Twitter to connect with rappers in Atlanta looking for beats – all while still in high school. Ever the ardent supporter, Metro’s mom was willing to drive the 17-hour commute to Atlanta from St. Louis on weekends – provided that he was back in school by Monday. Soon, Metro was spending his weekends in the studio with OJ Da Juiceman and Gucci Mane, which led Leland Wayne to rechristen himself as Metro Boomin. “Metro” stems from the bus line in St. Louis, and “Boomin” comes from OJ Da Juiceman, who constantly described Leland’s beats as “booming!”</p><p>In 2012, Metro was accepted to Morehouse College, the prestigious Atlanta HBCU. By that time, he had already started gaining some buzz in the Atlanta rap scene and just months into the first semester, his momentum grew bigger than he expected. “Karate Chop”, his collaboration with Future, became a surprise hit (going on to become the lead single off the rising Atlanta rapper’s second album Honest). Doors started opening and the industry was paying serious attention. But as an 18-year-old freshman, Metro was met with an extremely difficult decision. He could either continue his education and do music on the weekends, or drop out and fully pursue his dream.</p>

<p>“Every day, I would leave class, and go to the studio with either Future or Gucci [Mane] exclusively. Every day was between them – a lot of times two the same day. Go to one session then go to the other,” he says. “So having to get up early for class and having all that homework, it was just a lot. I knew I had to make a choice, rather than slacking in both these areas. I called my mom in the back of the studio and told her I wanted to take a semester off.”Like any mother reacting to their son dropping out of college, she was furious. However, Metro was still relieved. The decision has undoubtedly paid off, and while his mother’s sacrifices didn’t work out exactly how she had intended, she has certainly reaped the benefits from her son’s alternate route to success. With his focus fully on music production, there’s nothing standing in Metro’s way. Well, except right now – in the present – he’s a little distracted. Metro is still rummaging through his leather MCM bag, looking to find the right pendant and ring to match a full look from lauded fashion designer Raf Simons.

Next to him is close friend and photographer Gunner Stahl, who took on the important role of loft DJ for the day. Throughout the six-hour shoot, Stahl plays a lengthy Metro playlist, and for six hours straight everyone in the space gets hyphy, milly-rocks, bumps their head, or dances to one hard-hitting beat after another.

<p>As the playlist transitions from one banger to the next, from Future to Kanye West, Drake to Young Thug, it becomes astounding at how deeply Metro’s sound has permeated the rap industry during his relatively short time in the game. Fittingly, a period of great prosperity or rapid economic growth is the literal definition of the word “booming,” which is part of the title of Metro’s debut 2013 mixtape, 19 & Boomin’, which featured Atlanta artists like Trinidad James and Gucci Mane. But despite his quick ascent, it’s clear the success hasn’t gone to Metro’s head. The 24-year-old producer remains relatively down-to-earth, able to happily talk about Star Wars and the pop culture phenomenon Black Panther as much as his already-impressive catalog of work, downplaying his accomplishments with a low-key sense of humility.

Instead of bragging about all of his hits that are pounding through the space, he’s opening up about other producers and his favorite beats. He expresses an appreciation for The Neptunes’ entire catalog, specifically calling out the bare-bones drums of Clipse’s “Grindin’”, Kanye West and Brian “All Day” Miller’s beat for Cam’ron’s “Down and Out” off of Purple Haze, and Lil Wayne’s “Prostitute 2” off of Tha Carter III – a beat produced by his friend Maestro, who actually wrote Metro a letter of recommendation to attend Morehouse College.</p></div>
