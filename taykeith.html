<div class="h1"><h1>Tay Keith is the 21-year-old Memphis producer who wants to unite his city through music</h1></div>
<div class="text"><p>Memphis rap is in the midst of a special moment. The city’s youngest and brightest talents, from Blac Youngsta to Paper Route Empire protege Key Glock, and now BlocBoy JB, are actively developing their own distinct takes on what Memphis rap can be, and showing that it can thrive beyond the borders of its region. At the heart of this new wave of talent is 21-year-old producer Tay Keith, who’s not only lent his spooky chords, knocking bass and 808s, and wicked hi-hats to Memphis rap’s heavy hitters and rising stars alike, but has done so in a time when divides in the city run deep, and are highly publicized. In being able to work across beefs and conflicts by prioritizing the music and his personal relationships, he recognizes he’s in a rare position — one he hopes to use to eventually unite his city, and provide resources and infrastructure to help Memphis rap reach its fullest potential.</p>

<p>At the moment, Keith’s got a lot going on: “Look Alive,” the mega-hit he produced for Drake and his childhood friend and collaborator BlocBoy, has spent four weeks in the Billboard top 10; he’s doing more traveling to work with artists beyond Memphis, and is rocking parties in central Tennessee — all the while wrapping up his senior year at Middle Tennessee State University. Over the phone from Atlanta, where he’d just finished a session with Wiz Khalifa, Keith took some time out to talk about coming up in Memphis’s storied rap scene, making hits with his childhood friends, the art of self-discipline, and his desire to unite his city through music.</p>

<p><b>Where did you grow up? What was your upbringing like?</b></p>

<p>I grew up in Memphis, Tennessee, born and raised. It was hard. I stayed with my momma, then I ended up moving with my daddy. I always knew music was gonna be my outlet, I just didn't know when, or how it was gonna happen.</p>

<p>I grew up in the area where we had Three 6 Mafia, and Playa Fly, and 8Ball & MJG. My parents and my family used to listen to it. I learned from them there, and got more into it — listening to the beat of songs, and just learning more about music. Nobody was involved in music at all. I was the first one besides my brothers, they rap. I got two brothers and two sisters — I'm the youngest.</p>

<p><b>What first got you into making music and producing? I know you were rapping at first.</b></p>

<p>I was like 13, 14 years old. I had a Rock Band mic, and I used to record music and put it on YouTube and DatPiff. Then I started getting to producing my own music because I didn't want to keep rapping on beats I was getting on SoundClick. After that, I had started getting paid off of the beats I was putting on YouTube. That started giving me a check, so eventually I just focused more on production. I was using Mixcraft. I had my own equipment and a piano. I used to practice songs and remaking songs on it. I remember Lil Wayne's “Lollipop” — I used to play the keys to that song. That kind of had me interested in continuing to do it.</p>

<p>My big brother, he was recording on Mixcraft. [I would] watch him rap and record, then I just started doing it on my own computer. I'm mostly self-taught, but Drumma Boy and Memphis Track Boy give me good advice, and this other producer called Lil Lody, they actually give me a lot of advice, because they from Memphis, and they’ve made their way out too. I met Drumma Boy in Atlanta at an artist showcase. As far as like Memphis Track Boy, we [met] going to the studio.</p>

<p><b>The darker chords you use sound influenced by the older generation of Memphis rap, but hearing your drums reminds me of Atlanta rap, too. Did you listen to that sort of stuff growing up?</b></p>

<p>It was a lot of music from down south like Ludacris, like 2 Chainz, and Yo Gotti, pretty much the whole south. The sound really originated from Memphis, as far as like Three 6 Mafia, DJ Parlor, DJ Squeaky. They had a big influence on the whole Memphis sound, Juicy J and them. So I just bumped the wave back up of the old Memphis music. Atlanta got a lot of stuff that Memphis don't got. One is unity, and two is creativity. It’s like I brought the Memphis sound from Memphis to Atlanta in a sense.</p>

<p><b>What was the first opportunity that really got you involved in the Memphis rap scene?</b></p>

<p>When I was producing for Blac Youngsta, we had did a song. When he first signed with CMG, I had produced the song on his tape called “Whole Life.” On his next tape called Young and Reckless, I did three beats. From there, he had dropped a mixtape called Fuck Everybody, and I had produced “Lil Bitch,” the single on the mixtape, and that got me a buzz in Memphis and Atlanta, where I’d gotten a lot of opportunities after the song came out. That was two years ago. I just kept working with Moneybagg Yo, Blac Youngsta, and Blocboy JB, and I just progressed from that point on.</p>

<p><b>Was there a moment that you remember where you can say you had found your sound?</b></p>

<p>It was a lot of trial and tribulations. It had to be Blac Youngsta and Moneybagg Yo, that’s who I defined my sound with because, as their careers built, I kept building my sound also. The “Gang Gang” record, it definitely defined my sound, with the crazy bass and hi-hats. Also the other stuff I did for Blac Youngsta and Moneybagg, like “Lil Bitch” and “No Dealings,” those crazy hi-hats and 808s set me aside from every other producer.</p>

<p><b>How would you describe the current state of Memphis’s rap scene from your perspective?</b></p>

<p>The Memphis rap scene now is on a come up. We've got a lot of artist trying to be heard, but then we got a lot trying that ain't been heard yet. They just got to put a little bit more effort into it. But I mean, it's like Memphis is so divided, where it's two different sides. People don't really work with the other side, but like I had kind of broke that chain. That's how I feel I expanded past it.</p></div>
