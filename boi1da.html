<div class="h1"><h1>Toronto Super Producer Boi-1da Talks Drake's 'God's Plan,' the Creative Process for G-Eazy's 'No Limit' & Remaining Humble </h1></div>
<div class="text"><p><h2>2/5/2018 by Ashley Lyle</h2></p>
 
<p>Kingston, Jamaica-born and Toronto-raised super producer Boi-1da has been dropping hits for the past decade.</p>

<p>From breaking out with Drake's 2009 smash "Best I Ever Had" (peaking at No. 2 on Billboard Hot 100), Boi-1da has worked with the likes of Kendrick Lamar ("The Blacker the Berry"), Kanye West ("Real Friends"), Nicki Minaj ("Freedom"), and more. He's also become a frequent collaborator of Drake's, having worked with Young Aubrey on several of his singles, including "Over," "Miss Me," "Headlines," the DJ Khaled-led "No New Friends," "0 to 100/The Catch Up," and "Summer Sixteen."</p>

<p>The behind-the-scenes heavyweight currently boasts an impressive three records in the top 10 of the Hot 100 chart this week (dated Feb. 3) with Drake's "God's Plan" debuting at No. 1 and his "Diplomatic Immunity" debuting at No. 7, and G-Eazy's (feat. A$AP Rocky and Cardi B) "No Limit" sitting at No. 10 (previously peaking at No. 4). Hardly a rookie to the top 10, the Toronto producer had already twice reached the apex of the Hot 100, with Rihanna's "Work" and Eminem's "Not Afraid," with the latter also debuting at No. 1, as well.</p> 

<p>Despite his astounding and consistent run, the producer has surprisingly kept a relatively low profile, doing few interviews, and focusing on making more music and building his catalog. Billboard hopped on the phone recently with Boi-1da to discuss his recent success, his family (who keeps his business on point), and what keeps him grounded.</p>

<p><b>How did "God's Plan" come about?</b></p>

<p>It was a half-finished record that Drake had. He came to me and needed me to put a bounce to it to rock a certain way. So I ended up adding some drums to the record. It came out well. I vibed with it and did what needed to be done. It came out as an amazing record.</p>

<p><b>When you heard the finished product, did you know it was going to be a smash?</b></p>

<p>Oh yeah, instantly. With Drake, he never misses. Soon as I heard it, I knew it was going to be great.</p>

<p><b>Is the story of how "God's Plan" came together with similar to "Diplomatic Immunity?"</b></p>

<p>"Diplomatic Immunity" actually happened the same night. I was really inspired and ended up playing it for him. And when Drake hears something he likes, he gets on it and it's actually what he did.</p>

<p><b>How did G-Eazy's "No Limit" come about?</b></p>

<p>I was in the studio with G-Eazy, and it's funny because it was the first beat I played for him. He flipped out when he heard it and immediately started writing to it. Randomly, A$AP Rocky was in the same studio, and just happened to walk into the room. He heard the beat as well and was like, "Yo. I really like this beat. Is it cool if I try something on it?"</p>

<p>And after, he just hopped on the beat. What he did was almost a freestyle. I didn't see him write anything down. He just went in the booth and started going crazy. And then, they just took that. G added the second hook and verses, then the song was done. Then, he got Cardi B to jump on it. It was cool because we got to sit and vibe and come up with cool ideas. We figured it out.
